# SensorD
This car game tries to replicate the feeling of the classic old arcade games where you could start your gameplay instantly, in this game my main motive was to make sure every person can enjoy the game and can play as many times as the player likes to get themselves in top ranks, ranks are all global and are used to compare their Sensor-ing skills with others, compete with other scores and try their level best to be the #1 player of this game.
